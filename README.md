# File  sorter designed for Windows

## A fully functional file sorter written in Powershell and Python enabling user to automatically sort files created or added into your directory!

This is a project that was built to learn automation using powershell, powershell execution from python and making life easier. This simple code makes your newly created/moved files go into one of the three categories:

* PDFs
* Images
* Rest

## How to install and setup this project

The easiest way to do this is to do it this way:

1. Clone the project
2. Make sure that you have Powershell and Python (with subprocess and os libraries) installed
3. Run the python file
4. Add the path that you want to monitor for changes (in a model ...:/.../...
5. Click ENTER and watch it run

When running the project next time you won't need to add the path. If you want to change it tho, delete the path from directory.txt and you are ready to go.

## How to sort already existing files

The thing is that I don't know yet. I am currently working on a project that will let you do it, so stay tuned.
