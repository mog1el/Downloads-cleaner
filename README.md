## A fully functional file sorter written in Powershell and Python enabling user to automatically sort files created or added into your directory!

This is a project that was built to learn automation using PowerShell, PowerShell execution from Python and making life easier. This simple code makes your newly created/moved files go into one of the three categories:

* PDFs
* Images
* Rest

The easiest way to do this is to do it this way:
